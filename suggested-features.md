# Suggested features

The features below are ones suggested during the course of development that could be added during future increments/iterations once the project report is complete. Where I have implemented these, I will mark them DONE.

+ Add a "wizard" for admin users to create their first site.
+ Use rector to check code.
+ Use PHP documenter to develop documentation.
+ Send email asynrchronously (this is mostly set up).
+ Let the email user edit the email.
+ Routes to use names/slugs instead of ids.
+ Conditional email depending on the Party.
+ Let users use and pay for other mailing services.
+ Support domain names per site.
+ Manage billing and paying invoices in the admin area.
+ Security/Validation/Sanitisation.
+ Privacy and cookie policy.
+ Cookie pop-up.
+ Accessible design.
+ Sections using div tags.
+ Export data.
+ Dark mode logo.

Other tasks that I need to complete to assist with potential new features are:

+ Go through old emails to identify pain points in using the current software.
+ Go through questionnaire.
+ Ask colleagues for their idea.
