## Posted project idea to project preparation forum:

###Idea 1: A low-cost Email Your MP service.**

**Which L3 course(s) will be the base for this project .....**

TM352 and TM354

**The problem is ....**

It appears that there is not a low-cost option for setting up an email your MP microsite and accessing MP data with minimum developer time. My employer provides this service via WordPress, which involves a £1,000+ in setup fees and £20pcm +VAT in hosting. We experience issues with WordPress caching and the server overhead of running a WordPress multisite instance for multiple clients, however. Other providers charge £1,000s for access to the data and incorporate it into their client’s sites. My employer wants to be able to provide the functionality via a SaaS model in which organisations can set up their site with a few clicks and thus only pay the hosting cost.

**The stakeholders are ....**

My employer, my colleagues, charities, campaigns, APPGs (https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/registers-published-in-2023/), and consultants.

**The user is ....**

Charities, campaigns, APPGs, consultants, and members of the public (frontend only).

**I have/will be able to find out more by talking to .....**

The stakeholders listed above and those offering competing products.

**The skills I have from my L3 study include these which are relevant to the problem ...**

PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Cloud Computing, APIs, Lifecycle Models, Software Architectures, and Design Patterns

**The ways in which I will be moving my skills and knowledge beyond the L3 module(s) are  ...**

Developing SaaS, with an emphasis on security and efficiency.
**Any legal or ethical ramifications that might occur ....**

The processing of personal data is covered by the Data Protection Act 2018 (UK GDPR). Creating a low-cost service of this nature may dilute the effectiveness of campaigns. The service could be used to harass and intimidate MPs.

**The end product I will deliver will be ....**

This will potentially require building a service that incorporates a static site generator, domain name purchasing, DNS setup, form functionality, access to our MP data API, sending email, and storing personal data for the client. A nice to have would be a mobile app to create such sites and monitor the data stored / emails sent.
