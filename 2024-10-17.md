Been busy these past few weeks due to various issues outside of the project.

Added a new task today ready to get going again and adjusted the end date to December to factor in the delay.

Added a second task around using different email templates depending on the Party being emailed as requested by BVRLA. This will require a change to the db to move the email subject and text to JSON fields.
