Realised this morning that accessibility mode isn't what I meant to add. I meant accessibility checker. I can manually check the default pages but, as there's the ability to alter the design, I could do with a way of campaigns checkign that their colour meet WCAG.

There are various tools and plugins that enable this. I assume there may be one for Symfony. If not, I may wish to look at APIs that can be integrated, though those could cost the campaigns using the service.

Completed the removal of annotations to TMA03. Also finished reading tutor feedback today and have begun to make alterations as well as proofreading for tense.
