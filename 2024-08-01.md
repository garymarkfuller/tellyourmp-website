Attending Typo3 Developer Days 2024 from 01/08 to 03/08. 

A mock object is not what I thought it was. It's not a version of an object used for testing it's a pretend version of an object that lets me be sure the real object would be used properly by my code. Useful, but not what I thought I was testing with the API test in Tell Your MP. T3DD2024 talk on Doubles explained this.

Symfony DI talk - Worth watching back. It explains how to use services.yaml within Typo3 extensions to work with Symfonyâ€™s DI component. Also runs through how DI works, and is better than Service Location containers, with information on things like assigning dependencies in the constructor with arguments in the services YAML file. Also information on auto features - wiring, discovery, configuration. Information on setting defaults and parameters too.
