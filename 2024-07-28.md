Created the basic controllers and routes required for the application. I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps I've broken my tasks into the wrong focus. Individual units of functionality were perhaps not practical until later in the project. I've tended thus far to create things across the board. It may be worth re-engineering the sprints to reflect this. Will discuss with my tutor ASAP.
