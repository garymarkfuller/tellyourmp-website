Completed the alteration of the text to correct tense and added some more detail as I went. Made LSEPI a main section along with the literature review, which I moved before the Method. 

Need to add mention of M250 to the literature review and further citations to existing sections. Also need to add every book I've read but not cited to the Bibliography.

Added my final Gantt chart and the tables for this. Added example comment and discussed the lack of testing. Need more citations.
