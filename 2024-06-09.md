Set up EasyAdmin Bundle:

```
symfony console make:admin:dashboard
```

Created admin page, once for each entity:

```
symfony console make:admin:crud
```

I still need to test verifying email. I also need to work on limiting permissions and building out the admin area fully.

Also made a start on the API feature using:

The unit test doesn't seem to work quite as I'd hoped. I therefore need to do more reading on this. Perhaps, for now, creating the beginnings of the MP information page is the way to test the API call.
