Suggestions from Matt in stand-up:

Use tricks from Typo3 conference

app.flashes in twig templates with messages - Matt pointed me at the docs page. Not sure how I missed this [https://symfony.com/doc/current/session.html#flash-messages](https://symfony.com/doc/current/session.html#flash-messages). 

Mailer isn't sending through server but settings appear to be right. Showed me a trick for setting recipient on dev.

PHP documenter or similar worth looking into.
