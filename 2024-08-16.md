Suggestions from Matt in stand-up:

Use tricks from Typo3 conference

app.flashes in twig templates with messages - Matt pointed me at the docs page. Not sure how I missed this [https://symfony.com/doc/current/session.html#flash-messages](https://symfony.com/doc/current/session.html#flash-messages). 

Mailer isn't sending through server but settings appear to be right. Showed me a trick for setting recipient on dev.

PHP documenter or similar worth looking into.

Tried the config from Lighthouse - the member management system we made. Doesn't seem to have fixed it. 

Had a brief meeting with Matt to show him the issue. It turned out that the messenger component was trying to send the email messages asynchronously. The command below sent all the emails:

```php
php bin/console messenger:consume async -vv
```

He then told me the config to set it to send immediately.

I've added Twig and Async email as a todo comment. Strictly speaking, according to a talk at T3DD2024, I should just do the work or add an issue to GitLab. As I'm not using GitLab to trakc thr project, I'll hold off for now. 

Received an answer to my forum question last night. Have added a follow up question about formatting.

Excerpt from the mail log to show my email went through:

```

Added async sending to my crontab in case I get round to setting it up while I work on the next milestone. I also added a command to stop the sending as it doesn't seem to do so itself. From what I could see it was running every second for five minutes. I may therefore reduce the time to a minute. I could also up the frequency it runs at. I'll leave it for now, though, as it isn't urgent. 

```
@hourly /usr/bin/php /home/gary/tell-your-mp/bin/console messenger:consume async  >/dev/null
5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /home/gary/tell-your-mp/bin/console messenger:stop-workers  >/dev/null
```

I've completed the milestone - Microsite (TYM-9)

For this I needed to consider the experience of an individual trying to access the service to send an email. In the main, campaigns have shared just the "find my MP" page in the past, whereas I want this service to be more like Change.org by letting people explore. Below is the structure I broadly had in mind, which maps quite nicely to the admin structure too.  

1. There is an index page to show all of the microsites.
2. There is an index page to show all of the campaigns.
3. There is an index page to show all of the emails.
4. Each microsite has a page to show all of the campaigns it contains.
5. Each campaign has a page to show all of the emails it contains.
6. Each email has a success page for after it is sent.

I will probably need to alter the routes for individual microsites and campaigns to use title rather than id later on. For now, though, the pages are working so I can move onto design.
