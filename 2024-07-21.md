I noticed that my work laptop CPU was hitting 100 degrees on Friday, which could be dangerous for it. I guess that's a side-effect of going for a budget gaming machine to maximise power and GPU for use with machine learning models. As a precaution I'm moving everything off of it to OneDrive and to my physical backup today. Thankfully I have another laptop that has better cooling, which I could set up for completing my project.
