# About

## Me

I've been a student, a teacher, a campaigner and a Councillor (pretty much in that order, with some repetition). I currently build website themes and help out customers at Prater Raines, when I'm not studying for a degree in Computing or attending meetings.

## My Project

It appears that there is not a low-cost option for setting up an email your MP microsite and accessing MP data with minimum developer time. My employer provides this service via WordPress, which involves a £1,000+ in setup fees and £20pcm +VAT in hosting. We experience issues with WordPress caching and the server overhead of running a WordPress multisite instance for multiple clients, however. Other providers charge £1,000s for access to the data and incorporate it into their client’s sites. My employer wants to be able to provide the functionality via a SaaS model in which organisations can set up their site with a few clicks and thus only pay the hosting cost.

## This website

I'm required to keep a journal as part of the final year project. I started with a Word document, but it was proving unwieldy, so I decided to build a site. On top of building a site, I realised I needed a questionnaire to elicit user stories for the project, so this site contains said questionnaire.
