Started looking at the admin layout and, as ever, EasyAdmin has some handy fields to make life easier [https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html#field-layout](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html#field-layout).

Interestingly, I saw this yesterday but didn't parse the information. I've noticed that at some point in each day, I have to just take a rest from concentrating on the docs and just code. Clearly I'd reached that point yesterday when I started considering the admin page design. 

For each entity in the admin area I need to decide what fields to show for each action (index, new, edit, delete, detail, show) and also what actions to allow. 

## Actions

### Site

I need to remove the delete and detail action.

### Campaign

I need to remove the delete and detail action.

### Email

I need to remove the delete and detail action.

### SentEmail

I need to remove the new and edit actions and add the detail action.

### CampaignUser

I need to remove the detail action.

### EmailUser

I need to remove the new and detail action.

The actions changes are now complete.

## Fields

### Site

I should add featured image field. TODO

I should set labels/help text and hide when creating active, on form the ID and creation time, and on index the various design related fields. 

### Campaign

I should add the theme_overrides fields. TODO

I should set labels/help text and hide when creating active, and on form the ID and creation time. TODO

### Email

I should add the theme_overrides fields. TODO

I should set labels/help text and hide when creating active, and on form the ID and creation time. TODO

### SentEmail

I should set labels/help text and hide on index the ID and email HTML, and on detail the ID.

### CampaignUser

I should set labels/help text and hide on index password, and on form the ID and creation time.

### EmailUser

I should set labels/help text and hide on index the address details, and on form the ID, and creation time and associated email.
