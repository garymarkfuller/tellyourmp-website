Started looking at the admin layout and, as ever, EasyAdmin has some handy fields to make life easier [https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html#field-layout](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html#field-layout).

Interestingly, I saw this yesterday but didn't parse the information. I've noticed that at some point in each day, I have to just take a rest from concentrating on the docs and just code. Clearly I'd reached that point yesterday when I started considering the admin page design.
