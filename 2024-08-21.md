Started looking at the admin layout and, as ever, EasyAdmin has some handy fields to make life easier [https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html#field-layout](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html#field-layout).

Interestingly, I saw this yesterday but didn't parse the information. I've noticed that at some point in each day, I have to just take a rest from concentrating on the docs and just code. Clearly I'd reached that point yesterday when I started considering the admin page design. 

For each entity in the admin area I need to decide what fields to show for each action (index, new, edit, delete, detail, show) and also what actions to allow. 

## Actions

### Site

I need to remove the delete and detail action.

### Campaign

I need to remove the delete and detail action.

### Email

I need to remove the delete and detail action.

### SentEmail

I need to remove the new and edit actions and add the detail action.

### CampaignUser

I need to remove the detail action.

### EmailUser

I need to remove the new and detail action.

The actions changes are now complete.

## Fields

### Site

I should add featured image field.

I should set labels/help text and hide when creating active and creation time, on form the ID and creation time, and on index the various design related fields. 

### Campaign

I should add the theme_overrides fields.

I should set labels/help text and hide when creating active and creation time, on updating the site field, on index the image fields, and on form the ID and creation time.

### Email

I should add the theme_overrides fields.

I should set labels/help text and hide when creating active and creation time, on updating the campaign field, on index the email HTML field, and on form the ID and creation time.

### SentEmail

I should set labels/help text and hide on index the ID and email HTML, and on detail the ID.

### CampaignUser

I should set labels/help text and hide on index password, and on form the ID and creation time.

### EmailUser

I should set labels/help text and hide on index the address details, and on form the ID, and creation time and associated email.

For the rest of the day, I'll concentrate on my report research. Tomorrow I should add the additional "description" fields to site, campaign, and email entities and alter my db model to match. 

## Afternoon reading notes

Symfony lends itself to iterative releases because it handles application bootstrapping so thoroughly.
 
In theory, I should have used a burndown chart rather than a Gantt chart.
 
Gantt is used by project managers in traditional projects.
 
Pareto principle may be worth a mention. 
 
Should go through my journal and note potential features that I've discussed on a new page. I can then mark any that are implemented too and discuss them in my report.
 
In essence, you could say my Gantt chart also acted as a burndown chart as I added the individual tasks in a somewhat ad hoc way.
 
Delivering the functionality doesn't necessarily include delivering quality code. This could be a weakness of Agile shown in how my project lacks tests and security/validation/sanitisation wasn't a feature in its own right or inherent in each feature when tasks were created.
 
When adding tasks to feature sprints, I didn't prioritise them. Instead, I added them as I thought of them, or once I'd already implemented them.
 
Actually, I may not have needed to prioritise tasks as they were all part of implementing the overarching feature. 
 
There is a template burndown at [https://ineasysteps.com/resources](https://ineasysteps.com/resources).
