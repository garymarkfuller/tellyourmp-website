Wonder if I should talk about responsive design as the dominant paradigm in frontend development. Not sure it adds anything other than historical context. Ditto talking about Flex and Grid layouts. Though both do lead into where apps are used now nicely. Should ask my tutor.

Also wonder if I should discuss jQuery as the library that everyone says is dead, but that most sites still seem to use.

I've been thinking about whether to use Tailwind or Bootstrap. Both have been used by Prater Raines to design apps for the Lib Dems, though Tailwind was used with Typo3 and Bootstrap with Symfony. Rappin (2022) helped me make the decision to go with Bootstrap as it explains that Tailwind builds designs from multiple classes on a component, whereas Bootstrap relies on applying styles to components with a single class. I believe this paradigm will work better with the option to alter the design of a site on the backend.
