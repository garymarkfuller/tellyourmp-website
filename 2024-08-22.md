Added description fields to all the relevant entities. Now to add them to the frontend display. DONE

Next I'll add help text to the fields that I realised I missed yesterday. DONE

I believe there's an error in my model because I've not factored in the concept of collections.

An Email can have a collection of:

+ SentEmails
+ EmailUsers

An EmailUser can have a collection of:

+ SentEmails
+ Emails

Therefore, Emails and EmailUsers have a ManyToMany relationship. 

Also, an EmailUser needs a unique field - email_address, and the form needs to check if the EmailUser exists and update them if they do.

I did this by reading [https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#mapentity-options](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#mapentity-options) then looking at the related class for the find method to find the appropriate method. Thus I ended up with:

```php

            if ($entityManager->getRepository(EmailUser::class)->findOneBy(['email'=>$form->get('email')->getData()])) {
                $user = $entityManager->getRepository(EmailUser::class)->findOneBy(['email'=>$form->get('email')->getData()]);
            }

```

Fixed a bug in the registration page that was using my original entity structure for campaign users.

DONE - had to rebuild the database entirely.

I should also work on the dark mode logo option. 

I need to make sure the active toggles work, and also the start time field.

I should also improve the design button. I may copy what EasyAdmin does instead. 

I need to add the page on this site that lists the additional features I've thought of or that have been suggested - such as alternative emails based on specific data.

I still need to add the accessible design.

I also think I should add more div tags to act as sections within the design.

I think I may not have needed the uploader bundle. Will double check if I find time.

Also need to consider how organisations export data.

Just realised the email text omits the MP name and the supporter details.
