Added description fields to all the relevant entities. Now to add them to the frontend display. 

Next I'll add help text to the fields that I realised I missed yesterday.

I should also work on the dark mode logo option. 

I need to make sure the active toggles work, and also the start time field.

I need to add the page on this site that lists the additional features I've thought of or that have been suggested - such as alternative emails based on specific data.

I still need to add the accessible design.

I think I may not have needed the uploader bundle. Will double check if I find time.
