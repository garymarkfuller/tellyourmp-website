I've added user stories to the site today to make it easier to share them with the markers for the EMA. The questionnaire responses have helped me add to the stories I had considered (but not written down as anything other than features) previously. 

I've certainly not followed best practice thus far in terms of the order I've been doing things. I have broken the coding down into iterative increments, but the order of completion needed more consideration and the user stories would have worked better had the questionnaire been developed earlier and everything had been compiled as the relevant sprint started instead of all at once.
