Submitted my assignment today. Not happy with how far I managed to get. The whole thing felt a bit rushed and I'm caught between doing more research to back up my assertions and catching up with the coding aspects of the module. Hopefully the end of the school year should free up time to concentrate on both as Wednesday afternoons will be assigned to the coding of the project and Sundays to the research.
