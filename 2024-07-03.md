Discovered a new parliamentary API today. API could also be used for expanding project.

Need to contact tutor more. Use forum more. Put email queries in forum. Consider pair programming to speed things up.

New postcode mappings could be included in my report. Shutdown effects on stakeholders / clients are worth discussing.

The above points came out of today's tutorial (bar the API discovery), which was really useful. It also confirmed I needn't use every technique of Unit 8 of TM354, though it won't hurt to day why.
