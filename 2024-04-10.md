Have fallen behind and need to consider what I need for each step in coding the application. In retrospect, it may have been advisable to have chosen the April presentation as this, along with the waterfall model, may have better suited the time constraints of completing a second module, being a Cllr, and having children. It would have allowed for focusing on writing code during August, when the second module has finished, there are no council meetings, and there is no school run. 

Should complete a development log alongside the Journal. This could be done using Jira, Trello, or GitLab.

Would estimate that, of the 60 hours that should have been spent thus far across TYM-4, TYM-5, and TYM-6, only 20 have been completed. Each TYM sprint was aimed at completing 20 hours of work across two calendar weeks. This will need to be altered to reflect the time missed due to Spring Conference, TM358, and illness. 

Began moving journal to Github Pages. Thereâ€™s a bit more of an overhead in writing markdown, but it should be easier than editing a Word document when out and about.
