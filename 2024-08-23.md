### Notes

The new email user setup means I need a granular way to store email permissions against specific emails.
 
It'll be harder, but, realistically, it should be at campaign level.
 
Need to fix where images save to as well.
 
Save CSS overrides to separate CSS file and hook off of site ID class on HTML.
 
For override in overrides ...

### Today

Created the suggested features page and added to it from my journal.

Will also use this as a general to do as it can be hard to find tasks I've not added to Jira if I'm still debating implementing them.

Receievd my TMA03 back. Pleased that my mark has exceeded 85%. Just need to ensure I manage that for the EMA too.
