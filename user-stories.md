# User Stories

The layout for these is based on the template provided in Scrum For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Layton and Morrow, 2018).

## As a campaigner

> I want to be able to create a user account
>
> So that I can use the service.

> I want to be able to generate a microsite
>
> So that potential supporters can see what campaigns I'm running

> I want to be able to create a campaign associated with a microsite
>
> So that potential supporters can see what the campaign is about and send emails to their MPs

> I want to be able to create an email campaign, including uploading a word document
>
> So that it can be sent to MPs by potential supporters

> I want to be able to easily edit existing sites, campaigns, and emails
>
> So that I can add new information as circumstances change or as outreach events are arranged

> I want to be able to run multiple emails and campaigns simultaneously
>
> So that I can maximise the impact of using the tool  

> I want to be able to send emails with attachments
>
> So that MPs can find out more about the campaigns that I'm running

> I want to be able to run campaigns separately from my main website
>
> So that I'm not required to give third parties access to my website

> I want to be able to access and store data on email senders and site usage
>
> So that I can analyse the data and contact senders

> I want to be able to customise the design of the microsite
>
> So that I can make it more effective in encouraging supporters to send emails 

## As a potential supporter

>
> So that I can see what campaigns they are running

> I want to be able to find out about campaigns
>
> So that I can decide whether or not to support them

> I want to be able to input my contact details in, and submit, a form
>
