Completed the final aspects of TMA02. Not confident that there is sufficient evidence included in this TMA. Will need to do more to support and explain my choices (as well as recognise issues with them) in TMA03. Completing the EMA for TM358 should free up time to focus on the project. Also, completion of the TinEye and hosting projects at work should free up time to build the application.
