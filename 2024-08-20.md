One of our clients has requested additional functionality for the existing product, namely a conditional option to email different messages to different parties. I may therefore need to update the model to include an email per party. I think the best thing to do is have a default letter and offer the option to add letters for specific parties. I can then test in the code for those letters when sending the email.

Another additional piece of functionality that occurred to me is to allow users to use other mailing services. I know that Symfony supports this, so it would be a case of making this conditional. 

A further thing I've noted is that the use of a journal has made it a lot easier to complete this project now that I have the time to focus on it daily. It has aided recall through the act of writing things down and has meant that I have a record of ideas I can turn into features as the development of the software progresses outside of TM470. Another useful aspect of the journal is it can form the basis for documentation, along with the comments in the code. I will therefor be investigating how we might use a journal in Gitlab for other projects.
