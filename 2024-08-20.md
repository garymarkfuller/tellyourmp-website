One of our clients has requested additional functionality for the existing product, namely a conditional option to email different messages to different parties. I may therefore need to update the model to include an email per party. I think the best thing to do is have a default letter and offer the option to add letters for specific parties. I can then test in the code for those letters when sending the email.

Another additional piece of functionality that occurred to me is to allow users to use other mailing services. I know that Symfony supports this, so it would be a case of making this conditional. 

A further thing I've noted is that the use of a journal has made it a lot easier to complete this project now that I have the time to focus on it daily. It has aided recall through the act of writing things down and has meant that I have a record of ideas I can turn into features as the development of the software progresses outside of TM470. Another useful aspect of the journal is it can form the basis for documentation, along with the comments in the code. I will therefor be investigating how we might use a journal in Gitlab for other projects.

Matt made the point in the stand-up that the CSS options need to include dark mode and also that making conditional emails may require altering the workflow so that people put in their postcode before they see the email. Matt is also happy for me to look into adding a journal in Gitlab. 

Added getters and setters for the various design attributes to site entity. Used link instead of button in the property name as it will cover both. Once these work, I'll implement them for dark mode.

Used [https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html](https://symfony.com/bundles/EasyAdminBundle/current/fields.html) to help me pick the fields and set them up. 

I've made the design overrides work in light mode for individual sites and the subordinate campaigns and emails. It feels a little hacked together. but it works. I need to set the default values for the fields in the backend. Not sure how to do that. I also need to add the dark mode options. Then I need to tidy it up look wise. I also need to add the logo_size field and move the site name display to the header.

Dark fields are:

1. dark_text_color
2. dark_background_color
3. dark_header_background_color
4. dark_footer_background_color
5. dark_heading_color
6. dark_link_color
7. dark_link_hover_color

Dark mode complete. Also, default values was actually quite easy:

```php
    /**
     * Creates a new site entity, setting those values that shouldn't be set by an admin user.
     * 
     * @param string $entityFqcn The fully qualified class name (FQCN) of the entity to create.
     * @return Site
     */
    public function createEntity(string $entityFqcn)
    {
        $site = new Site();
        $site->setCreateTime(new \DateTimeImmutable('now'));
        $site->setActive(true);
        $site->setCampaignUserId($this->getUser());
        $site->setThemeOverrides([
            'text_font' => 'system-ui,-apple-system,"Segoe UI",Roboto,"Helvetica Neue","Noto Sans","Liberation Sans",Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol","Noto Color Emoji"',
            'font_size' => 100,
            'text_color' => '#212529',
            'link_color' => '#0d6efd',
            'link_hover_color' => '#0a58ca',
            'dark_text_color' => '#dee2e6',
            'dark_link_color' => '#6ea8fe',
            'dark_link_hover_color' => '#8bb9fe',
            'heading_font' => 'system-ui,-apple-system,"Segoe UI",Roboto,"Helvetica Neue","Noto Sans","Liberation Sans",Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol","Noto Color Emoji"',
            'heading_color' => '#212529',
            'dark_heading_color' => '#dee2e6',
            'background_color' => '#FFFFFF',
            'header_background_color' => '#FFFFFF',
            'footer_background_color' => '#FFFFFF',
            'dark_background_color' => '#212529',
            'dark_header_background_color' => '#212529',
            'dark_footer_background_color' => '#212529',
        ]);
        return $site;
    }
```

Just need a logo size field and to make the page usable for admins now.

Added a logo size field, then was sidetracked making the header region look better by fixing the design button. Need a better name for that.

Next job. Organise fields in the site admin page and generate an accessible view that shouldn't be editable.
