After a long period of being busy with other things I've managed to find time in the past couple of days to work on the project. We have two new clients for the WordPress version of this project, which has helped add weight to the need to re-develop it in Symfony. 

I've added proper validation and sanitization both server side and client side using the relevant Symfony components. I may add further JS to ensure that the submit button can't be clicked at all withouth correctly/safely completing fields, but I'm happy with the progress so far.
