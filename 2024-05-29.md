Read Additional study materials for TMA 03 and EMA:

- Skills of Analysis and SynthesisWebsite content 

- Writing, Structuring, Styling and Editing Reports

Watched podcasts on completing project as had yet to do so.

Ordered Weaver, P. (2003) Success in Your Project: A Guide to Student System Development Projects, Prentice Hall, ISBN 0-273-67809-4.

Read tutor feedback on TMA02. Still need some clarity on the literature review vs research for the coding aspects of the project. I suspect I've effectively mixed these up. It also occurred to me that my review should include studies on lobbying and campaigning. I suspect a search of the OU library for change.org would be useful.
