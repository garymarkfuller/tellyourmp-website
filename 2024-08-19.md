Began to complete the design today. Installed Bootstrap with the command:

```php
php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap
```

Applied some basic classes and added dark mode to the design. I used the JS provided by Bootstrap themselves to create a design menu. It seems a bit flaky but isn't my key focus. Instead I'm working on the design elements.

The elements I've identified are:

1. Logo image
2. Logo image size
3. Campaign featured image
4. Campaign featured image size
5. Email featured image
6. Email featured image size
7. Text font
8. Text colour
9. Heading font
10. Heading colour
11. Base font size
12. Button colour
13. Link colour
14. Header colour
15. Body colour
16. Footer colour

Information on using Bootstrap taken from [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).

I've made the default form look better and made it responsive using [https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_customization.html#functions](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_customization.html#functions). I now need to consider the above variables and how to store them against a site.
