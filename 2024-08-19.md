Began to complete the design today. Installed Bootstrap with the command:

```php
php bin/console importmap:require bootstrap
```

Applied some basic classes and added dark mode to the design. I used the JS provided by Bootstrap themselves to create a design menu. It seems a bit flaky but isn't my key focus. Instead I'm working on the design elements.

The elements I've identified are:

1. Logo image
2. Logo image size
3. Campaign featured image
4. Campaign featured image size
5. Email featured image
6. Email featured image size
7. Text font
8. Text colour
9. Heading font
10. Heading colour
11. Base font size
12. Button colour
13. Link colour
14. Header colour
15. Body colour
16. Footer colour

Information on using Bootstrap taken from [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).

I've made the email and register forms look better and made them responsive using [https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_customization.html#functions](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/form_customization.html#functions). I also made their layout in the code easier to read. I now need to consider the above variables and how to store them against a site.

I decided to take a leaf out of WordPress's book and store the theme overrides listed above as JSON field, in a not dissimilar way the the wp_postmeta table in WordPress (though this uses a longtext field for values). This has the advantage that I won't end up with a multitude of null fields in the database for each individual override. I also hope that it will make it easier to use with Bootstrap.

Started to look at file uploads. Installed the UploaderBundle recommended by the Symfony Docs at [https://symfony.com/doc/current/controller/upload_file.html](https://symfony.com/doc/current/controller/upload_file.html):

```
composer require vich/uploader-bundle
```

Will work on using this tomorrow. I also need to make the login page responsive too.
