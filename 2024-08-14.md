I should include reference to the quotes below in my final write up. 

> The guidelines for writing a good user story can be summed up with the acronym INVEST:
> 
> I - Independent: user stories should be able to be described apart from one another.
> 
> N - Negotiable: all of the features in a product are the product of negotiation
> 
> V - Valuable: there’s no reason to spend time writing a card that isn’t valuable to your users
> 
> E - Estimatable: each user story needs to convey a feature that the team can assign as size or effort number to
> 
> S - Small: user stories should describe independent interactions, not huge categories of functionality
> 
> T- Testable: being able to test each user story is what makes it such an effective feedback loop for Scrum teams

Note (from the same text):

> INVEST and the three C’s originated with XP, which you’ll learn about in the next chapter. You can read more about them in the original 2003 post by Bill Wake: [http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/](http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/) (as he mentions, the three C’s were originated by XP pioneer Ron Jeffries)

I should consider reading the blog post, although I'm more focused on Scrum than XP.

> INVEST
> 
> Bill Wake, an early influencer in the eXtreme Programming (XP) movement, the INVEST mnemonic for user stories. INVEST is an acronym for qualities that you want to look for in your user stories:
> 
> • Independent (to the best degree possible): The story doesn’t need other stories to implement it or for the user to interact with it.
> 
> • Negotiable: The product owner and the development team must discuss and expand on the story’s nuances and details. The value of a user story is in the conversation, not the card.
>
> • Valuable: The story shows product value to the customer, not the technical steps (tasks) that the developer uses to enable the story.
>
> • Estimable: The story is refined enough for developers to estimate the amount of effort required to create the functionality.
>
> • Small: Smaller stories are easier to estimate. A rule of thumb is to bring six to ten user stories into each sprint, so a story should be able to be finished by one or two people during the sprint.
>
> • Testable: The story needs to be testable so that the development team knows that the story has been done correctly. “It needs to be fast” or “It needs to be intuitive” isn’t testable. “I need to get a response from the application in less than a second” or “I need to complete the action in three clicks or less” is testable.

I've realised the choice to focus on Scrum could do with more explanation. I've put together some articles around Scrum as used by small teams and individuals which I will read and add reference to.
