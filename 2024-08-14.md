I should include reference to the quote below in my final write up. 

> The guidelines for writing a good user story can be summed up with the acronym INVEST:
> 
> I - Independent: user stories should be able to be described apart from one another.
> 
> N - Negotiable: all of the features in a product are the product of negotiation
> 
> V - Valuable: there’s no reason to spend time writing a card that isn’t valuable to your users
> 
> E - Estimatable: each user story needs to convey a feature that the team can assign as size or effort number to
> 
> S - Small: user stories should describe independent interactions, not huge categories of functionality
> 
> T- Testable: being able to test each user story is what makes it such an effective feedback loop for Scrum teams
