I should include reference to the quotes below in my final write up. 

> The guidelines for writing a good user story can be summed up with the acronym INVEST:
> 
> I - Independent: user stories should be able to be described apart from one another.
> 
> N - Negotiable: all of the features in a product are the product of negotiation
> 
> V - Valuable: there’s no reason to spend time writing a card that isn’t valuable to your users
> 
> E - Estimatable: each user story needs to convey a feature that the team can assign as size or effort number to
> 
> S - Small: user stories should describe independent interactions, not huge categories of functionality
> 
> T- Testable: being able to test each user story is what makes it such an effective feedback loop for Scrum teams

> Bill Wake, an early influencer in the eXtreme Programming (XP) movement, the INVEST mnemonic for user stories. INVEST is an acronym for qualities that you want to look for in your user stories:
> 
> • Independent (to the best degree possible): The story doesn’t need other stories to implement it or for the user to interact with it.
> 
> • Negotiable: The product owner and the development team must discuss and expand on the story’s nuances and details. The value of a user story is in the conversation, not the card.
>
> • Valuable: The story shows product value to the customer, not the technical steps (tasks) that the developer uses to enable the story.
>
> • Estimable: The story is refined enough for developers to estimate the amount of effort required to create the functionality.
>
> • Small: Smaller stories are easier to estimate. A rule of thumb is to bring six to ten user stories into each sprint, so a story should be able to be finished by one or two people during the sprint.
>
> • Testable: The story needs to be testable so that the development team knows that the story has been done correctly. “It needs to be fast” or “It needs to be intuitive” isn’t testable. “I need to get a response from the application in less than a second” or “I need to complete the action in three clicks or less” is testable.
