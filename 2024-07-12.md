I've completed the final process of reinstating our MP API in the past couple of days. I've also created a list of the APPGs from the previous parliament with details of their secretariats and public contact details. This gives a potential client list for the next parliament, alongside charities and campaigning organisations. 

As the data for the existing API comes from another system developed by Prater Raines, I've also been working on creating my own copy of the data so that we can spin out our own version of the API with additional fields for the new project. As part of this, the new Parliament API will be useful.
