The GE result has resulted in some changes to how I work on my project. The Email Your MP API needs to be rebuilt with new data for MPs and for constituencies. 

I have created a list of all 650 new MPs mapped to the gss codes for their constituencies. There are currently only around 300 MPs with email addresses. I have created an API call to get the rest of the data when it becomes available.

The API I found in the last week should be really useful for adding datapoints to our internal API. There's also demographic data that can be added to support campaigns. Although this won't necessarily affect the scope of the current project, it should give me avenues for further development and study.
