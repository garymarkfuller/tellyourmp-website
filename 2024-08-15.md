Discussed my thoughts about the order of developing items in the stand-up and I'm less convinced that I've developed things in the wrong order. I merely haven't considered, yet, the order in which users will interact with the admin area. 

I should therefore consider that process in more detail, and add it to my Gantt chart.

My initial thoughts are:

1. Register as a CampaignUser
2. Login to admin area - redirected to Sites admin page
3. Create a site
4. Redirected to Campaigns admin page
5. Create a campaign
6. Redirected to the Emails admin page
7. Create an email
8. Redirected to Dashboard admin page
9. Can now see all menu items with only those entities created by your user

One issue with this is how do I manage multiple CampaignUsers for the same Site. Many to Many will be the required relationship long-term. 

I should also run Rector, which we use for PHP version upgrades, on my project. It can also ensure I'm following coding standards.
