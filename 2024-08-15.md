Discussed my thoughts about the order of developing items in the stand-up and I'm less convinced that I've developed things in the wrong order. I merely haven't considered, yet, the order in which users will interact with the admin area. 

I should therefore consider that process in more detail, and add it to my Gantt chart.

My initial thoughts are:

1. Register as a CampaignUser
2. Login to admin area - redirected to Sites admin page
3. Create a site
4. Redirected to Campaigns admin page
5. Create a campaign
6. Redirected to the Emails admin page
7. Create an email
8. Redirected to Dashboard admin page
9. Can now see all menu items with only those entities created by your user

One issue with this is how do I manage multiple CampaignUsers for the same Site. Many to Many will be the required relationship long-term. 

I should also run Rector, which we use for PHP version upgrades, on my project. It can also ensure I'm following coding standards. This was suggested during the stand-up because I have a tendency to leave random whitespace in my code (much to the amusement of the rest of the team).

There's a temptation to get sidetracked as I have ideas. That makes me realise how useful the journal is. 

On that note:

I should prevent the ability to add and edit EmailUsers. I should instead have a view button that shows the list of emails sent. This makes me realise I need a further entity SentEmail that should contain the data on the email sent and who to.

I ended up adding the SentEmail entity, linked to an EmailUser and Email. I also altered some of the relations so that I could generate a migration that associates a Campaign to a Site. I considered having SentMail be part of an EmailUser but realised you would probably want to see the emails sent separately as a CampaignUser. This does mean I need to fix the display of Email entities in the admin area, as their associated campaigns can't be converted into a string (not sure why that's the case, but perhaps it's because I made it nullable).
